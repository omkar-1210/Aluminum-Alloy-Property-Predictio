# Aluminum-Alloy-Property-Prediction
Developed a Deep Neural Network in Python to predict the mechanical properties of high-strength aluminum alloys. Optimized the model to achieve a high predictive accuracy (RÂ² score: 0.8842) and used Explainable AI (LIME) to provide transparent, data-driven insights, accelerating the material design process.
